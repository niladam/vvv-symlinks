# Fish shell that generates symlinks to all the sites in the www directory
# of the vvv vagrant (https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)
#
# v1.0 - 25 Nov 2016
# * initial commit to git
# * small changes.
# Let's configure some vars
#
# As a general rule, please make sure you DO NOT USE SPACES in directories.
#
# MAINDIR usually under $HOME -- but you can tweak this to your liking
# If you don't know how to change this i suggest you leave it as is and
# make sure that VAGRANTDIR matches your actual location
#
set MAINDIR			$HOME
#
# The VAGRANTDIR should be the folder where you have vagrant installed.
# Personally, i handle this by creating a symlink in my homedir for quick
# access to it (ln -s /path/to/vagrant $HOME/vagrant)
#
# NO TRAILING SLASHES -- as these are used in the script.
#
set VAGRANTDIR		"vagrant"
#
# The VAGRANTWWWDIR is by default www, but someone might actually want
# to tweak this to suit their needs..
#
# NO TRAILING SLASHES -- as these are used in the script.
#
set VAGRANTWWWDIR	"www"
#
# The SITESDIR should reflect where you want your links to exist.
# Personally i use a folder called sites under my home directory
# (mkdir $HOME/sites)
#
#
# If the folder does not exist, it WILL BE CREATED upon firing up the script
#
# NO TRAILING SLASHES -- as these are used in the script.
#
set SITESDIR		"sites"
#
# The REMOVEONUP variable instructs the script to
# remove all symlinks in SITESDIR when vagrant is starting.
# Basically this makes sure that if a site is removed between up/halt
# a link to it should no longer exist
# Should we remove the links when the vagrant machine starts?
# accepted values: yes/no (default value is yes)
#
# yes = upon vagrant up all symlinks in the SITESDIR are removed.
# no  = upon vagrant up no symbolic links are remove from SITESDIR
#
#
set REMOVEONUP		"yes"
